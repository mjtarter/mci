                <p class="dorm-desc">These dorms are in a prime location for Business &amp; SPEA majors. However, they are the furthest dorms from most other classes, so taking the bus is usually a must. The Northwest is in close proximity to Assembly Hall and Memorial Stadium and most athletes are put into these dorms. They are also the most popular choice of incoming freshman and are therefore the most difficult to get into.</p>
                <p>Perfect for: Individuals who are outgoing and able to get work done in a somewhat noisier and more distracting environment. This is also a good area for "partiers", business majors, and those who are planning to rush a frat/sorority.</p>
